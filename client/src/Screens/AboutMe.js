            On a Friday night during the Spring of 2019 I fell into the wormhole
            on Youtube and discovered a basic html and css course on accident.
            It's safe to say the rest is history. I immersed myself into the
            topic and continued to discover the capabilities of what can be
            created with programming and design frameworks. From creating
            beautiful interactive designs to creating functionalities that help
            people resolve problems, the possibilities and routes of this field
            captured my imagination and curiosity.

            <br />
            Soon after the completion of that course I enrolled into Rutgers
            University's Coding BootCamp and completed their course in December
            2019. I am an eager and ambitious individual that is looking to
            contribute to an amazing team!
